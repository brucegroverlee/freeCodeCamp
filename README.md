### Project description

This code contains a very basic introduction to Reinforcement learning using TFJS.
The goal is for this to be interactive:
  - where the player will choose rock, paper or scizzors.
  - then the agent will choose what it thinks is the best action
  - then the player will tell the agent if it did bady or poorly
  - the agent will then update its ideas on which actions are good and bad
 
The choice of actions are visualied using plotly.js and we can see them change over time.
